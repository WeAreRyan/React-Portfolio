    <h1>About Ryan</h1>
    <div>
    I am a full stack developer and software engineer with a background in
        technical support and customer care. As a recent graduate of the General
        Assembly SoftwareEngineering Immersive I am eager to exercise my skills
        and creativity. At my core I am a problem solver with a knack for
        discovering, deconstructing and resolving complications within opaque
        circumstances. I offer an analytical outlook with highly developed
        communication skills to any working environment.
